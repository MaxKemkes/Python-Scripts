### Remove BG
 
Thiss is a little python application to automatically remove backgrounds of images. It was inspired by a youtube video I saw. Just install the dependencies from requirements.txt and chose the pictures you want to to edit.
Note: Double clicking on the files you want to edit does not work. Easygui has known bug for double clicking. Please press "open" on the folderbox or hit Enter
